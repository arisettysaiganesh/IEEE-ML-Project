# IEEE-ML-Project

Early and accurate detection of corn diseases is crucial for effective crop management
and minimizing yield losses. However, traditional methods often involve delays or require
specialized expertise, hindering timely intervention. This project addresses these
challenges by developing an automatic corn leaf disease recognition system using
machine learning (ML) on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform.
The proposed system prioritizes timely detection by leveraging the power of AI and ML
on the Jetson Nano, enabling rapid disease identification directly in the field. Accessibility
is a key consideration, ensuring the system is user-friendly and deployable by farmers
with varying technical backgrounds. Furthermore, the system is designed to be adaptable,
capable of learning from diverse datasets to address the unique disease challenges faced
by different corn species and regions.
By incorporating on-device processing capabilities through the Jetson Nano, the system
eliminates the need for reliance on external resources and facilitates real-time disease
monitoring in agricultural settings. This project contributes to the development of
practical and accessible tools for farmers, empowering them to make informed decisions
for improved crop health and yield optimization.
